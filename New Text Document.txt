Summary:  Unsure where to start? Use this collection of links to our articles and videos to learn about some principles of human psychology and how they relate to UX design.
Bringing psychology and technology together is at the heart of UX design because UX is people. However, you do not need a degree in psychology to understand the basics of how humans function. Most psychological principles that are relevant to UX are easy to understand but make a big difference when applied correctly. Since the beginning, NN/g has always preached that the best designs are built for people as they really are — not who we wish they were.

Don Norman (one of our principals) calls himself a cognitive designer because regardless of the type of products you are working on, what matters is that you design systems for how people think. The following resources will help you explore and understand many of the psychological principles that help create the best user experiences and achieve an organization’s goals.

Attention
Although most people feel like they notice everything going on around them, their ability to do so is very limited. Humans cannot focus their attention on everything at once — their brains automatically filter out anything that doesn’t seem useful.

UX-psychology
Article Contents

UX/UI design, in layman’s terms, is all about creating an engaging and intuitive user experience (UX) and user interface (UI). But here’s the twist: it’s about understanding how users think, feel, and behave when interacting with digital products. This is where psychology comes into play.

We’ve all tried to navigate a poorly designed website or app that leaves us feeling frustrated and confused. It’s because the design doesn’t align with our cognitive processes. When we encounter something unfamiliar or complex, our brain goes into overdrive trying to figure it out. 

We avoid these pitfalls by designing with psychology in mind. This means understanding cognitive load theory (the amount of mental effort required to process information), visual perception principles (how we see and interpret visual information), and emotional responses (how we feel when using a product).

For instance, consider Amazon’s one-click buying feature. From a psychological perspective, it reduces cognitive load by simplifying the decision-making process — one click, and your purchase is on its way! The result? A seamless user experience that keeps customers coming back for more.

Good UX/UI design isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about creating an intuitive and enjoyable user experience that aligns with our psychological processes. This is how UX/UI design plays an important part in conversion rate, dropoff rate, user satisfaction, and user retention rate. 

Theories of Perception in UX/UI Design
Perception is the phenomenon that enables us to make sense of the world around us. And guess what? It plays a pivotal role in UX/UI design too! In the realm of UX/UI design, we’re concerned not just with how things look but also how they are perceived and interpreted by users. This is where theories of perception come into play. 

The Gestalt Psychology theory suggests that humans perceive visual elements in groups or as a unified whole rather than as individual components. We instinctively search for patterns and order in complex visual stimuli to make sense of them. Ever noticed how your Instagram feed is organized into a grid format? That’s Gestalt psychology at work! The grid layout groups related content together, making it easier to process and navigate.

When we design, we don’t just throw elements randomly onto a screen; we carefully arrange them to facilitate pattern recognition and ease cognitive load. By understanding and applying these perception theories, we can create more intuitive and user-friendly designs.

Cognitive Load: Its Effects on UI Design
In the world of UX/UI design, we’re wrestling with cognitive load. This refers to the total amount of mental effort being used in working memory (think of it as your brain’s RAM). Too much information or overly complex tasks can overload this system, leading to errors and frustration.

In UI design, we aim to minimize this cognitive load to ensure a smooth and enjoyable user experience. It’s like hosting a dinner party — you wouldn’t want to overwhelm your guests with too many dishes at once. Instead, you’d serve them in courses, allowing them time to savor each dish.

The same applies in UI design. We aim for simplicity and clarity over complexity and ambiguity. Take Google’s homepage for example: its clean, minimalist design puts users at ease by reducing cognitive load. There aren’t multiple menus or excessive text vying for attention. This allows users to focus on their task without unnecessary distractions.

Managing cognitive load is all about understanding human limitations and designing accordingly. By doing so, we can create interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also cognitively considerate.

Emotional Response & UX Design
As UX/UI designers, we don’t just design for functionality; we also design for emotion. Our aim is to evoke positive emotional responses from users through our designs.

We achieve this with a blend of psychology and artistry. We strive to understand what makes users tick — their desires, frustrations, and habits — and then translate these insights into design elements that resonate with them on an emotional level.

One technique is color psychology. Different colors can elicit different emotions in people. Blue often conveys trust and reliability (think Facebook or LinkedIn), while green tends to be associated with growth and tranquility. We can subtly influence how users feel when interacting with our interfaces.

We have to ensure that each step in the process is intuitive and satisfying — from the moment they land on the homepage to when they complete their intended task (be it making a purchase or finding information).

Good UX design isn’t just about reducing cognitive load; it’s also about creating an emotionally engaging experience. This can foster brand loyalty and turn casual users into raving fans.



The Role of Memory in User Interaction
Memory plays a pivotal role in shaping user interactions. Humans are creatures of habit. We’re wired to remember and repeat past actions that have yielded positive results.

When we interact with an interface, we rely on our cognitive map to guide us through the process. This means that consistent design patterns and recognizable elements can significantly streamline user interaction.

However, while familiarity breeds comfort, it also breeds expectation. If an element looks like something users have interacted with before but functions differently, it can lead to confusion and frustration. So while we want to leverage users’ memories to enhance usability, we also need to ensure consistency in functionality across our designs.

By understanding how memory works and applying this knowledge in our designs, we can create interfaces that feel intuitive and familiar, making the user experience not just functional but also delightful. 

Understanding User Behavior Through Heuristics
Heuristics, or mental shortcuts, are the unsung heroes of UX/UI design. They allow us to predict and anticipate user behavior, making our designs more intuitive and user-friendly. But understanding these cognitive shortcuts is not as simple as memorizing a list of do’s and don’ts.

Consider the “recognition over recall” heuristic. It posits that users are better at recognizing information they’ve previously encountered than recalling it from memory. This principle explains why drop-down menus are generally more effective than open-ended input fields.

We must balance this heuristic with others, like “less is more.” Overloading a drop-down menu with too many options can lead to choice paralysis. Heuristics guide us in crafting experiences that align with how users naturally think and behave. We can create interfaces that feel instinctive and effortless to navigate.

usability-heuristics

The Impact of Attention on User Experience
Let’s consider a simple yet effective example about attention: push notifications. These little pop-ups are designed to grab our attention amid a sea of digital distractions. They work on the principle of selective attention, which allows users to focus on specific elements while ignoring others. Overuse or misuse of these notifications can lead to attention fatigue, causing users to disengage or even abandon the platform altogether.

We must remember that guiding user attention is not just about making things noticeable. It’s about creating an environment where relevant information stands out without overwhelming or annoying users.

User Motivation & Reward Systems in UX/UI Design
In UX/UI design, we’re tasked with understanding what makes users tick and then leveraging that knowledge to create engaging, satisfying experiences. When it comes to driving user engagement, few tools are as potent as motivation and reward systems.

These systems tap into our innate desire for achievement and recognition. They incentivize users to engage with a platform by offering rewards — tangible or intangible — for completing certain actions or reaching specific milestones.

Consider the example of fitness apps. These digital coaches often employ gamification techniques to motivate users toward healthier lifestyles. Users might earn badges for hitting their daily step goals or receive motivational messages after logging workouts consistently. This is more than just fun and games; it’s about creating positive feedback loops that encourage continued use and engagement.

It’s important to note that while reward systems can be powerful motivators, they need to be thoughtfully designed. Overly complex systems can confuse users, while too simplistic ones may fail to engage them effectively. It’s all about striking the right balance — a dance between challenge and reward that keeps users coming back for more.

In essence, motivation and reward systems are vital cogs in the UX/UI design machinery. When done right, they can transform passive visitors into active participants, turning an ordinary user experience into an extraordinary one.

 

Developing User-Centric Experiences in the Restaurant Industry

We closely collaborated with a client from the restaurant industry to synchronize the charm of their in-location ambiance with a highly advanced e-commerce platform. Our software development team committed itself to crafting a new website. Our design strategy revolved around creating a seamless, user-centric interface that guides customers through their ordering process. This streamlined and intuitive shopping experience ensures customers can place orders and track their journey from purchase to delivery.

 The end result is a platform where customers feel just as valued and indulged as they would in person, offering a true reflection of the brand’s essence.

 

Five Additional Principles
Let’s delve into these five cognitive psychology theories:

Retention theory: Users spend a limited time on a homepage, suggesting that concise design aids faster progression.
Serial-position effect: Users remember the first and last elements more than those in between.
Hick’s Law: Too many choices lead to delayed response time, so avoid overwhelming users.
The Schema theory: Organizing information into meaningful units is appealing.
The chameleon effect: Mirroring user emotions aids connection and understanding.
In Conclusion
UX design and psychology share a common goal: understanding human cognition patterns, decision-making processes, and consumer needs. By incorporating these cognitive psychology theories into our work as UX designers, we can avoid certain design pitfalls while discovering solutions that enhance user experience.

Psychology helps you understand what users want, sometimes even better than they do.

Psychology and UX design go hand in hand. Psychological principles outline how people respond to stimuli and what motivates them to take specific actions. Designers can use this information to create more effective sites. By better understanding subconscious behaviors like shape recognition, designers can satisfy expectations users might not even know they have.

When designing a fitness app, for example, you could place exercise goals inside upward-facing triangles. These shapes signal growth and progress, subtly encouraging people to work out and reach new milestones. 

8 principles of psychology in design
The following eight psychological principles play a big part in UX design and have remained relevant through many years of experimentation and peer review.

1. Color theory
Colors affect how people interpret websites, and designers can use these feelings to subtly influence website visitors’ emotions. That’s what makes color theory so powerful — it helps designers decide when to select one color over another. 

Blue, for example, denotes dependability and integrity, while red signifies danger and urgency. For this reason, websites tend to use blue when showcasing security and privacy features and red when calling attention to an alert that requires immediate action.

2. Hick's Law
Hick’s Law states that it takes more time to make a decision as options increase in complexity or volume. When too many stimuli compete for attention, the short-term memory overloads, causing people to avoid making a decision.

Every stimulus source increases the cognitive load on the brain. The cognitive load is the effort it takes the brain to understand a situation. Leveraging Hick’s Law in your web design means reducing cognitive load to give your users options that are easy to understand. 

For example, a restaurant’s online ordering page could start with categories like Pasta, Pizza, and Salads. Patrons can choose between those three options before selecting a specific dish so they won’t be overwhelmed by seeing the entire menu at once.

3. Gestalt principles
Gestalt psychology studies how humans perceive complex images and recognize patterns. Many principles of Gestalt psychology apply to UX design, including symmetry, similarity, and continuity. Understanding these foundations helps designers understand how users interpret websites. 

Take similarity, for instance, which refers to people naturally grouping similar-looking items together. Designers can leverage this effect by making the “Next page” button a consistent color and shape across the website. This approach allows visitors to quickly identify and understand the button's purpose, improving navigation.

4. The golden ratio
The golden ratio is a visually appealing ratio of 1:1.618, which appears in nature in places like the shape of a ram’s horn or the number of petals growing on a flower. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci have used this ratio in famous works, and it still has a place in modern-day design.

When UX designers size elements according to this ratio, their layouts are easier to understand because they follow a natural convention. This principle even applies in typography — making headers 1.618 times bigger than the body font clearly marks headers as important information.

5. Anchoring bias
Anchoring bias occurs when people give more value to information they receive early in the decision-making process. Say shoppers see a table comparing two subscription service tiers, and the first column has fewer features than the second. Because the first column looks more basic, people will be more likely to buy the second tier, even if they don’t need all the listed features.

Web designers use anchoring bias by front-loading information they want readers to internalize. For example, designers might create a homepage stating their client’s product is “protected by enterprise-grade security” or “backed by cyber-security professionals” so users are more likely to trust the brand.

6. Persuasive design
Persuasive design uses visual and social cues to affect people’s emotions. Designers use techniques like storytelling and color theory to subtly persuade their audience to complete desired tasks, often increasing conversions. 

One example of a common persuasive tactic is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. Designers and marketers use limited-time offers or timed content to make their audience feel they’ll miss out on something if they don’t act fast. This pressure encourages customers to make a purchase or sign up for email campaigns.

7. Social proof
Social proof refers to accolades, customer reviews, and testimonials that brands use to improve an audience’s perception of their products. Potential customers are more likely to trust shoppers’ or outside institutions’ opinions of a product since they’ll see these endorsements as unbiased.

Say a designer is building a website for a car company. To prove the cars are safer than competitors’, designers can feature safety awards on the brand’s homepage. This social proof signals that customers’ families will be safe during accidents, leading to more sales.

8. Scanning patterns
When people read a website, they tend to follow either an F-shaped or Z-shaped pattern, so named because that’s how readers’ eyes travel across the page: 

Z-shaped pattern — Users start by scanning horizontally across the top from left to right, then diagonally down and across again. Website visitors who follow this method will better understand the whole site.
F-shaped pattern — Readers first review the top of a page before scanning down just the left side, which can lead to missed details in the middle and right sections.
Designers aim to discourage F-shaped patterns by using strategies such as clear headings, bolded key terms, and structured lists. 

These formatting choices emphasize important information, encouraging visitors to slow down and pay more attention to the content. By fully engaging the reader, you may be able to teach them something new or convince them to check out your client’s product.

Why psychology matters in web design
User testing, focus groups, and surveys are all great at capturing user feedback, but these research methods don’t assess the subconscious reasons people respond to content. When web designers consider psychological principles, they use decades of established data to decide which elements will catch readers’ attention. Understanding visitor intent allows teams to build websites that suit people’s needs and nudge them to complete desired tasks.

The psychology behind great UI design

You know those designs that just feel right? The ones where everything seems to be exactly where it should be, and you don’t have to squint, think, or rage-click to figure things out?

That’s not magic. It’s psychology.

Good UI design doesn’t just happen because you picked the right shade of blue or used a beautiful font. It works because it understands how people think. What they notice, what they ignore, and what makes them quietly swear under their breath.

Let’s break down the psychology behind great UI design so you can build experiences that make users feel like geniuses, even if they haven’t had coffee yet.

1. Your brain’s a lazy genius (cognitive load)

Here’s the thing: the human brain is powerful, but also wildly lazy.

We’re constantly trying to conserve mental energy. That’s why good UI design doesn’t make people think more than they need to. If your app feels like a puzzle, users will leave, and possibly leave a strongly worded review on the way out.

Design isn’t about showing off how clever you are. It’s about making users feel smart.

Tips that won’t melt brains:

Use clear hierarchy. One main action per screen is usually enough.
Avoid unnecessary choices. This isn’t a quiz show.
Hide complexity until it’s needed. (Yes, “advanced settings,” I’m talking about you.)

2. The “too many choices” problem (Hick’s Law)
Hick’s Law is simple: the more options you give someone, the longer they take to choose. And the more they want to cry. Or quit.

Have you ever stared at a dropdown with 30 countries listed alphabetically starting with “Afghanistan”? Yeah, that.

Design is about decision reduction. Not by removing freedom, but by making the path obvious.

Design like a minimalist:

Break big tasks into smaller steps.
Highlight the most common or recommended options.
Use defaults, because most users will go with them anyway.
3. Targets should be easy to hit (Fitts’ Law)

Tiny buttons. Super thin text links. Close-able modals with an “X” smaller than a fruit fly.

We’ve all cursed them. Fitts’ Law says the time it takes to click something is based on two things: its size and distance. So if you want people to actually tap your button, make it tappable.

Practical ideas:

Increase touch targets, especially on mobile. No one has the finger precision of a ninja.
Place primary buttons where they’re easy to reach. Think thumb zone.
Avoid stacking actions too close together. Accidental taps are the new rage click.
4. Visual hierarchy: Why your users are lost

Users don’t read screens top to bottom. They scan like squirrels on espresso.

So you need to control the visual hierarchy like a conductor leading an orchestra. Use size, color, weight, and spacing to say, “Hey, look here first!”

Without hierarchy, everything competes for attention. And when everything is shouting, no one gets heard.

Try this:

Bold for primary actions. Lighter weights for less critical stuff.
Use white space like it’s your job. (Because it is.)
Want a quick test? Squint at your design. What stands out? That’s your focal point.
5. Familiarity beats creativity
You might want to be the Picasso of buttons or reinvent the navigation bar. But guess what? People like what they know.

There’s a reason login forms always have email and password in the same order. It’s not laziness. It’s familiar.

What to do:

Stick with standard UI patterns for key flows: sign up, checkout, navigation.
Save the creative stuff for microinteractions or visuals, not fundamental layouts.
Remember: Familiar = trustworthy. Weird = suspicious.
6. Group things that belong together (Gestalt psychology)

Gestalt psychology is basically our brain’s way of speed-reading reality. We don’t see things as isolated elements. We group them based on proximity, similarity, alignment, and continuity.

If your UI doesn’t respect these patterns, users will be confused. And confusion is the fast lane to closing your tab.

Examples:

Buttons that look the same should do similar things. Don’t trick people.
Put related fields in forms close together. Don’t scatter ‘name’ and ‘email’ like easter eggs.
Align content. Misaligned items trigger subconscious discomfort.
7. Emotion > logic
Here’s a secret: people make decisions emotionally, then justify them logically. That applies to UI, too.

Think about it. Have you ever clicked a button just because it felt nice? That satisfying hover? That subtle animation?

Design can spark joy, or frustration.

How to design for feelings:

Use microcopy with personality. A little charm goes a long way.
Animations should feel like butter, not a Michael Bay movie.
Create moments of delight: a cheerful success message, a confetti animation, or a satisfying loading state.
8. People remember peaks and endings (Peak-End Rule)

Users don’t remember every second of their journey. They remember the most intense moment and the ending. That’s the Peak-End Rule.

So if your checkout flow is seamless, but the confirmation screen looks like a 404 page, guess what they’ll remember?

Design tip:

Identify your “peak moments.” Make them delightful.
Never neglect your endings. Confirmation messages, thank-you screens, sign up success pages, they matter more than you think.
9. The real UX villain: Uncertainty
If your user isn’t sure what a button will do, they’ll hesitate. And hesitation kills momentum.

The best UIs remove doubt. They say, “Hey, click here. It’s safe. You won’t accidentally delete everything.”

Use these weapons:

Clear labels: “Save draft” is better than “Submit.”
Microcopy: A small line of text can eliminate fear.
Feedback: Show what just happened, and what’s next.
10. Tools that keep you sane

Let’s be honest, sometimes, you just don’t have the time to build every flow from scratch. That’s where a plugin like Made in Figma can be a lifesaver.

It lets you drop in pre-built UI flows and components that already follow best practices. No guesswork. No hunting for inspiration. It’s like having a design co-pilot that doesn’t talk too much.

I use it regularly when I want to move fast without sacrificing quality, or when my brain is running on caffeine fumes and I just need a solid layout to riff on.

Bonus: If you’re still reading…
First of all, thanks. You’re clearly serious about good design.

Second, here’s your cheat sheet for psychology-powered UI:

Cut the noise (less = better)
Guide the eye
Respect defaults and patterns
Design for emotion, not just logic
Help users feel in control
And when in doubt? Don’t be clever. Be clear
