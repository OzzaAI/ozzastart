            "pattern_of_thought": "Consider which aspects of the UI can be safely themed (colors, logos, typography) without breaking the shared user experience. Ensure brand-specific changes remain within defined theme settings and do not alter core layouts or interactions. If a requested customization conflicts with usability or core design principles, prioritize consistency across tenants for maintainability. Enable white-label flexibility through data-driven theming while preserving the platform's overall coherence."

            "pattern_of_thought": "Weigh the benefits of a visually elegant solution against its potential to confuse or slow down users. Favor clear, straightforward designs: obvious controls, descriptive labels, and intuitive layouts, even if they appear simpler or less \"flashy.\" Ask, \"Will every user understand this easily?\" If a decorative element or animation doesn't enhance usability or clarity, simplify or remove it. Strive for an interface where visual appeal never undermines the user's understanding."

            "pattern_of_thought": "Determine the minimum role or permission needed for each feature or content area. If the current user lacks the required access, default to hiding those controls or sections to avoid confusion and maintain security. Only show a restricted feature (grayed out or with an explanation) if it's useful to hint at its existence (e.g., to encourage upgrade or request access), and never reveal sensitive details. Ensure that what is visible in the UI strictly aligns with what the user is allowed to do. Always pair these visibility rules with back-end enforcement, reflecting a defense-in-depth mindset."

            "pattern_of_thought": "Check the user's account plan and any feature flags before exposing a feature in the UI. By default, hide or disable features that the tenant's plan doesn't include. If appropriate, replace a hidden feature with an upgrade prompt or tooltip so users know what they're missing (without overwhelming them with non-functional UI). Use a consistent gating mechanism (centralized checks or context) to avoid mismatches. For each feature, think, \"What does a user without this flag or on a lower tier see?\" and design accordingly. The goal is a scalable UI that adapts to each tenant's entitlements seamlessly."

            "pattern_of_thought": "Adopt a mobile-first perspective and ensure layouts can stretch or contract gracefully. Consider scenarios like very small screens, very large monitors, or extreme content (long names, numerous items) when designing. Use fluid grids, flex layouts, and appropriate breakpoints so content reflows without breaking. Ask, \"How will this look on a phone? On a tablet? With double the content?\" If a layout issue emerges (e.g., overlapping or overflow), simplify the structure or hide non-critical content behind toggles. Prioritize the display of important information and actions at all sizes, ensuring the interface remains clear and usable on any device."

            "pattern_of_thought": "Treat accessibility as a core requirement, not an afterthought. Use semantic HTML elements (buttons, links, form labels) and ARIA attributes where needed so assistive technologies can interpret the UI. Always ensure sufficient color contrast and provide text alternatives for icons or media. Think, \"Can a person navigate this with a keyboard only? Will a screen reader adequately describe this content?\" If not, adjust by adding proper roles, labels, or restructuring the component. The pattern is to design for the broadest range of users from the start—considering vision, hearing, motor, and cognitive differences—so that the interface is usable and pleasant for everyone."

            "pattern_of_thought": "Determine if the requested solution can be made configurable or broadly useful rather than hard-coded for one tenant. Ask, \"Could other tenants benefit from this? Can we make this a setting or theme option?\" Prefer building flexible components or features that can toggle behaviors based on data or config, instead of duplicating code or creating tenant-specific branches. If a unique customization is unavoidable, encapsulate it cleanly (e.g., within a theming rule or feature flag) so it doesn't affect others. This ensures the platform remains maintainable and scalable, accommodating special cases without compromising the overall system integrity."

Ensure every action has an immediate visible response: loading spinners for in-progress operations, success messages or highlights for completed actions, and clear, polite error messages when something goes wrong. Consider edge cases: \"What if this data fails to load or returns empty?\" Design informative empty states or error states with guidance (e.g., \"No records found\" or \"Connection lost. Retry?\"). Error text should be friendly and helpful, not technical, and should never leak sensitive details. By anticipating points of confusion or failure, and addressing them in the UI, you create a smoother, trust-inspiring user experience."

            "pattern_of_thought": "Stay aligned with the established design system and component library. Before inventing a new pattern, ask, \"Have we solved this type of UI elsewhere in the app? Can we reuse or adapt that solution?\" Reuse existing components and styles to maintain a coherent look and feel. If a new pattern is necessary, design it to harmonize with the current UI conventions (spacing, typography, interactions) so it doesn't feel out of place. Consistency improves usability by leveraging users' prior learning and makes the code more maintainable. Thus, err on the side of convention over novelty for most interface decisions."

            "pattern_of_thought": "Be mindful of the cost of advanced UI features. Ask, \"Does this interaction or media significantly benefit the user, and is it worth any slowdown it might cause?\" Prefer lightweight, optimized solutions: lazy-load images or data when possible, use CSS animations over JavaScript for simplicity, and paginate or virtualize long lists instead of rendering everything at once. If a high-impact feature (like a complex visualization) is needed, implement it in a way that minimally affects initial load (e.g., behind a user action or feature flag). The guiding thought is to keep the UI fast and efficient; a snappy interface often outweighs a fancy one in day-to-day use. Optimize early and avoid gratuitous features that would degrade performance on typical user devices."
